# Baseboard #

Baseboard is a better place to start your stylesheets.

## Details ##

Baseboard is an alternative to *Reset* and *Normalize*. It uses a semantic base to make future styling and inheritance easy to debug; no more mile-long tag-chaining.

Alternatively, you can install it from:

`npm install baseboard.css`

## License ##
