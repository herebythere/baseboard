#Baseboard#

##Abstract##

A comfortable place to start creating new CSS templates.

Check out the [demo](). It's as ugly as it should be.

##Details##

Baseboard provides an easy and safe place to begin creating new custom CSS templates. This compact stylesheet is meant for the developer who doesn't want (or need) a bulky boilerplate but also doesn't want to start from scratch. This template is the result of more than a few headaches and hopefully the solution to a few of yours. 

There are initial styling differences between browsers and operating system that usually go unoticed *until* it's a problem. This stylesheet attempts to fix that. It is not about fonts, colors, menus, or making your website *pretty*.

The primary function of *Baseboard* is to create a common starting point for the most useful, semantic and functional HTML5 elements. The secondary function is to provide helpful classes that bring a little of the functionality expected of larger boilerplates. 

The purpose of *Baseboard* is to isolate future problems to just your declarations. The goal is to give design engineers and developers a little more control and a fair blank-slate.

I hope it helps!
