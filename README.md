# Baseboard

Baseboard is a stylesheet that can help you get started on projects.

It gives you a "good enough" place to start.

A lot of effort is made to normalize or reset a browser's default styling

But only a handful of elements are really used compared to the 100s available in HTML5

Baseboard reduces inconsistencies between browsers but does not add ridiculous rules to a stylesheet. Instead, it focuses on resetting known margins and paddings.

Typography is usually the first part of a "theme" so baseboard expects another stylesheet to handle typography or colors.

- don't worry about styling all the things
- browsers have different implementations of elements
- browsers use different rendering algorithms (colors, gradients)
- browsers use different composition (cairo, skia)
- browsers are constantly being upgraded
- browsers are being invented (epiphany, samsung browser)
