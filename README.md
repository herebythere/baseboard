# Baseboard #

## Abstract ##

Baseboard is a better place to start stylesheets.

## Details ##

Function, flow, and experience should be created by design teams and developers, not libraries or boilerplates. Baseboard lets you begin from (almost) nothing.

Baseboard is an alternative to *Reset* and *Normalize* and delivers a semantic reduction with a minimal footprint.

It's modular and easy to debug. There are no repeated declarations. Each element is apart of a single, semantic inheritance chain.

The purpose of Baseboard is to give developers, artists, and designers a fair blank-slate. It's the best place to start new projects.

Included:
* baseboard.css
* baseboard-min.css
* baseboard.scss

## Usage ##

Grab `baseboard.css` from the src directory and copy it into your resources or project directory. Rename it something related to your project.

Add your '@font-faces' after:

`/* Put @font-faces here.*/`

Add custom declarations after:

`/* Put custom declarations here. */`

## License ##

Baseboard is released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and is intended for students, artists, and small start-ups.
