#Baseboard#

##Abstract##

If CSS had a reset button, it would be Baseboard.

Check out this [demo](https://taylor-vann.github.io/baseboard). It's as ugly as it should be. 

##Details##

Terrible, right? Now compare it to the same [page](https://taylor-vann.github.io/baseboard/example/plank.html) without Baseboard. Initial browser defaults go unnoticed *until* it's a problem. Baseboard gives the most useful and semantic HTML5 elements in a clean cross-browser format.

Function, flow, and experience should be created by design teams and developers, not libraries or boilerplates. Baseboard supports this philosophy and lets you begin from (almost) nothing. Less than 75 lines eliminate default styling and reduce HTML elements to a purely semantic foundation.

The goal is to give developers, artists, and designers a little more control and a fair blank-slate.

##Usage##

Grab `baseboard.css` from the src directory and copy it into your resources or project directory. Rename it something relative to your project. 

Add your '@font-faces' after:

`/* Put @font-faces here.*/`

If necessary, style the body element after:

`/* Put body declarations (like fonts) here... */`

Add custom declarations after:

`/* Put custom classes here. */`
